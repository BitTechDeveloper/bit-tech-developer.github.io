This repository is to build challanging project from multiple online renowned sources like [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), [Front End Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/), [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) etc.   

Instead of creating a seprate repository for each project, which will create a mess in my github accout, I combined them in a single major repository.   

To distinguish the projects file from each other I named them according to their sources and project names, Specially first few character before `-` or `_` or for their source names like;   

- `fem-*` for projects from [Front End Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/)   
- `fcc-*` for projects from [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
- `Drb-*` for projects from [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/)

html and javascript file will be separate for each project but css will be same because I mostly used tailwindcss utility classes for styling.   

I built all these project with `vanilla javascript` no framework not even library.   

For configuration I used `Webpack` because for building multiple projects in a single repository `webpack` is best choice. This way I thought it will help me to practise managing mono repo.

Currently, I've built `3` projects from `Front End Mentor`.   

Here they are with their snapshots and links to published sites.
